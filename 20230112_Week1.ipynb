The raw dataset will be cleaned, validated, and then additional predictor variables will be engineered by discretizing some of the continuous variables and by combining variables into new summary statistics. The feature dataset will then used with several algorithms to determine the best predictor model. The models will then be evaluated and the best model will be selected for implementation in a production environment."

        "The Default of Credit Card Customer (DC3) data set, accessed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, was retrieved in January, 2023. The data consists of 30,000 observations on 24 predictor variables and a single binary response variable of payment default of credit card customers in Taiwan from April, 2005 to September, 2005. Default indicates whether the customer failed to repay a debt (e.g., 1, yes; 0, no). A default can occur when a customer is unable to make timely payments, misses payments, or avoids or stops making payments. The variable names and their definitions are listed in Table 1 below."
